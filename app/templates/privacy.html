    <p class="mb-4">We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information in compliance with the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and our use of Local Differential Privacy (LDP) to further enhance security and privacy.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1. Who We Are</h2>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2. What Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Survey Respondents:</strong> Information you provide while answering surveys, which may include demographic information, opinions, and preferences.</li>
        <li><strong>Survey Creators:</strong> Information such as name, email address, billing details, and account data.</li>
        <li><strong>Website Visitors:</strong> Information collected via cookies, such as IP addresses, browser types, and usage data.</li>

        <li>To process payments (if applicable).</li>
        <li>To communicate with you about your account, surveys, or updates.</li>
        <li>To analyze data for statistical purposes, in an aggregated and anonymized form.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your personal data to third parties.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4. Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data (GDPR Compliance)</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">Under GDPR, we process your personal data based on the following legal grounds:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">

    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">7. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">For GDPR compliance, any transfer of personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) is done with adequate safeguards in place, such as standard contractual clauses, to protect your data.</p>
